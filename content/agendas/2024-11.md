# Hi Everyone!  Sending you a reminder that our next 4-H meeting is scheduled for Sunday, November 17 @ 2 PM at the Grace Community Church.

Tomorrow’s agenda includes a guest speaker who will share information on animal/livestock judging which should be very cool! Reminder –  if you’re willing to share, please bring examples of your previous 4-H projects. There will be time to look at and hear about projects and categories of projects that you may want to explore for next year’s fair.  

Also, don’t forget that tomorrow night is the awards ceremony – Sunday night @ 6 PM in Building C.

Hope to see everyone tomorrow!

Jennifer
